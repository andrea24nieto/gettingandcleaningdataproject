This repository corresponds to the final project of the course **Getting
and Cleaning Data** offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.
It contains the instructions on how to collect, work with, and clean a data
set.

## Dataset 
The data that was used for this project corresponds to the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files
* ```{run_analysis.R}``` contains the code written to perform the following steps:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each        measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
